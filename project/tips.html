          <h3>Use Reusable Bags</h3>
          <p> 
            Using reusable bags is a simple yet powerful way to reduce waste and protect the environment. Instead of
            using single-use plastic or paper bags, reusable bags can be used again and again, which helps cut down on
            pollution and saves resources.</p>

            <h2>Why use reusable bags?</h2>

           <p>
            1._Reduce Plastic Waste – Plastic bags often end up in oceans and landfills, harming wildlife and taking
            hundreds of years to break down.
            2._Protect the Environment – Producing plastic bags uses fossil fuels and water, contributing to pollution and
            climate change.
            3._Save Money – Many stores charge for plastic bags, so bringing your own reusable bags can help you save money
            over time.
            4._Durability – Reusable bags are stronger and can carry more items than flimsy plastic ones.
            5._Support Sustainability – Using reusable products supports a more eco-friendly lifestyle and encourages
            responsible habits.
</p> 
           <h2>How to use reusable bags:</h2> 
            Bring them when you shop – Keep them in your car, purse, or backpack so you don’t forget.
            Clean them regularly – Wash your bags to keep them hygienic, especially after carrying food.
            Use different bags for different needs – For example, cloth bags for groceries, insulated ones for cold
            items, and foldable ones for everyday use.

            Encourage others – Talk to friends and family about the benefits of reusable bags and inspire them to switch
            too.

            Making the switch to reusable bags is a small change that can make a big difference.</p>
